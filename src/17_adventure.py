print("Description:\n")
print("""    You have finally made it to the age of 11. You have entered the castle ,and are waiting in a massive hallway. Before you 
is two large wooden doors. beyond the doors you hear merry laughfter and shouting. A tall, severe-looking woman with dark hair tied up in a bun.
comes through the wooden doors. up, and gracefully glides twordes us. She was tall, severe-looking woman with dark hair tied up in 
a bun. \"Welcome new students to Hogwarts. I am Professor McGonagall. The start of term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the 
Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house 
will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house 
dormitory and spend free time in your house common room. \n    The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and 
Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, 
your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with 
the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n
    The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves 
up as much as you can while you are waiting.\"\n    You look around and are comforted that you are not the only one nervous. Finnaly
 the great wooden doors open and you are ushered inside. \"File line, File line students.\" You enter the great hall quivering with 
the rest of the first years. You see four long woden tables outstreached to a stage where a four legged stool sits in front of the 
headmasters table. Ms.McGonagall was at the front placing an old frayed patched pointy wizards hat on the stool. As you look around 
you notice that everyone was now staring at the hat, you start staring at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. 
Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth --- and the hat began to sing: \n
    \"Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,\n
    But don’t judge on what you see,\n
    I’ll eat myself if you can find\n
    A smarter hat than me.\n
    You can keep your bowlers black,\n
    Your top hats sleek and tall,\n
    For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n
    And I can cap them all.\n
    There’s nothing hidden in your head\n
    The Sorting Hat can’t see,\n
    So try me on and I will tell you\n
    Where you ought to be.\n
    You might belong in Gryffindor,\n
    Where dwell the brave at heart,\n
    Their daring, nerve and chivalry\n
    Set Gryffindors apart;\n
    You might belong in Hufflepuff,\n
    Where they are just and loyal,\n
    Those patient Hufflepuffs are true\n
    And unafraid of toil;\n
    Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n
    If you’ve a ready mind,\n
    Where those of wit and learning,\n
    Will always find their kind;\n
    Or perhaps in Slytherin\n
    You’ll make your real friends,\n
    Those cunning folk use any means\n
    To achieve their ends.\n
    So put me on! Don’t be afraid!\n
    And don’t get in a flap!\n
    You’re in safe hands (though I have none)\n
    For I’m a Thinking Cap!\"\n\n
    The whole hall burst into applause as it finished its song. it bowed to each of the four houses and then became still again 
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward hoalding a roll of parchment. \"Once I have called your name come forward to be sorted 
into your house.\" One by one you see your classmates go up put on the sorting hat and after a while the hat would shout out 
the first year's new house. Finally your turn is up. You step up on the stage and sit on the stool. Ms.McGonagall sets the 
hat down on your head. You then hear a voise inside your head.\n""")
